# sample-coding-projects
Sample codes showcases covering:

(In Python)
• Design and evaluate (quasi) experiments for social scientists: RCT, RDD, IV.
• Network effects: high dimensional data visualization, linear and non-linear clustering and classification,
Gaussian mixture EM, social network graph centrality, spectral clustering and evolution.
• Neural network and deep learning: feedforward, recurrent, convolutional networks, Natural Language
Processing with reinforcement learning.
• Climate data time series analysis (trend, seasonality, stationary) and stats modeling with ARMA models,
Gaussian process and spatial prediction.
